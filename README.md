# sus93+
A small project that I spent several hours procrastinating on.

If you didn't know, sus93 is a package manager for Windows93.
It lets you install user-made packages from a command line interface.

sus93+ allows you to access that CLI without using a terminal!
You can install and uninstall any sus93 package with a retro GUI,
and crappy icons.

## Installation
Installation is even easier!
Simply click the link below, and it'll open the installer in W93.

Have fun! :)
